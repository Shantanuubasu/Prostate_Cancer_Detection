## ABSTRACT
 This project focuses on the analysis and classification of medical imaging data to enhance
 diagnostic accuracy. We utilized a dataset comprising NIfTI images with three modalities: K
trans, ADC, and T2W. The images were preprocessed to generate 3D matrices, followed by
 padding to accurately identify target areas. After splitting the data into a 70:30 ratio for training
 and testing, we experimented with several machine learning models including CNN, Random
 Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN. The respective accuracies were 69.38%, 70.41%,
 74.37%, 70.41%, and 70.42%.
 Given these results were suboptimal, we developed a hybrid CNN model with hyperparameter
 tuning, employing ReLU and Softmax activation functions. This enhanced model significantly
 improved performance, achieving a final accuracy of 78.57%. The results demonstrate the
 potential of hybrid CNN architectures in improving medical image classification and underscore
 the importance of preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and advanced model design in such
 applications.

 ## INTRODUCTION
This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy in
 medical imaging, specifically using data from three imaging modalities: K-trans, ADC, and T2W. Medical
 image classification plays a crucial role in the early detection and diagnosis of various diseases, and with the
 increasing availability of medical imaging data, there is a significant opportunity to leverage advanced
 computational methods for more accurate analysis. The dataset used in this project consists of NIfTI images,
 which were preprocessed to create 3D matrices, followed by padding to ensure uniformity and accuracy in
 the analysis. Various machine learning models, including CNN, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression,
 and KNN, were tested to classify the images based on predefined categories. After initial evaluation, a
 hybrid CNN model was developed and fine-tuned to enhance performance. This project aims to explore the
 potential of deep learning in medical image analysis, emphasizing the importance of data preparation, model
 optimization, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve higher classification accuracy. The final results
 demonstrate that deep learning, particularly hybrid CNN architectures, can significantly improve the
 performance of medical image classification systems, offering promising implications for clinical decision
making and diagnostic workflows.
 The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning models in
 automating the analysis of medical images, thereby aiding in faster and more accurate diagnoses. The
 project began with the collection and preparation of NIfTI images from three distinct imaging modalities: K
trans, ADC, and T2W. After preprocessing the data, which involved transforming the images into 3D
 matrices and applying padding for uniformity, various machine learning algorithms were tested for their
 ability to classify the images. The initial models, including traditional classifiers such as Random Forest,
 SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN, provided insights into their strengths and limitations. However,
 recognizing the complex nature of medical imaging data, a hybrid CNN model was developed, incorporating
 advanced deep learning techniques and hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance. The results of this
 study show that, with proper preprocessing and model optimization, machine learning models—especially
 deep learning models like CNNs—can provide significant improvements in medical image classification,
 ultimately paving the way for more reliable and efficient diagnostic tools in healthcare.
